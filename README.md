# Azure IOT C SDK and Protocol Gateway Replaceable TLS
This project to show how to replace SSL under TLS with an alternative protocol. Whay might you want to do this? In the general case, you may have a small-footprint IOT device that wants to send telemetry to the cloud with no intermediaries (device to cloud) but do so securely. Traditionally that means a field gateway.
